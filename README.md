# Overwatch_Aimbot
Outdated

Some very old aimbot used to created or sell long time ago, messy filing, used screen color detection method to avoid cheat detection to do the aimbot and marco functions. Some of them should be write in AHK and other are java, not quite remember already.
All outdated and not suggest to use directly, but able to reference if you want to create your own one for the updated version.
These is just served for archive purpose for me to clean up my disk space.
